<p>
A Pantheon pipeline provides a way for people to 
run, explore and understand a set of interconnected
ECP technologies.
</p>

<p>
By digging through the scripts, files and inputs that
make up a workflow, one can experiment with different
options, learn about how the simulations run, and 
develop new workflows based on the examples.
</p>

<p>
The scripts and files are designed to be played with,
and run in different ways after the initial installation.
</p>

<p>
It's as simple as digging in, making changes, and 
seeing what happens.
