<h3>1. Tutorial Overview</h3>

The goals of this tutorial are to:
<ul>
    <li>Provide an overall understanding of the Pantheon project.</li>
    <li>Show a workflow as designed to run on Summit.</li>
    <li>Provide hands-on examples of a workflow adapted to run in the tutorial VM.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>During this we will run the workflow, change files, and re-run the workflow. This will demonstrate the different steps, and how easy it is to experiment with a Pantheon workflow.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Tutorial Instructions</h3>

The tutorial is organized as a set of web pages with code examples and commands that are 
to be pasted into the shell as you work. Code snippets look like this:

<pre>
<code>
   # this is some code
   a = b
</code>
</pre>

Things that are to be cut and pasted into the shell look like this:
<pre>
<code class="cutpaste">
    this is to be cut and pasted into the shell
</code>
</pre>

Please note that copy and paste are different in Firefox and the shell:

<table class="cp">
    <tr class="cp">
        <th class="cp" width="100px">&nbsp</td>
        <th class="cp" width="100px">copy</td>
        <th class="cp" width="100px">paste</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="cp">
        <td class="cp" >Firefox</td>
        <td class="cp" >Ctrl+C</td>
        <td class="cp" >Ctrl+V</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="cp">
        <td class="cp" >Shell</td>
        <td class="cp">Shift+Ctrl+C</td>
        <td class="cp">Shift+Ctrl+V</td>
    </tr>
