<h3>2. Overview of Pantheon</h3>

The <a href="http://pantheonscience.org">Pantheon</a> project is a home for examples of reproducible workflows for 
scientific computing. 

A few terms to note:

<ul>
    <li>A <b>Project</b> is a collection of workflows with a well-defined scope and goal, defined by a common workflow template.</li>
    <li>A <b>Template</b> is a workflow pattern. </li>
    <li>A <b>Workflow</b> is a reproducible set of operations, based on a template. A workflow is defined by a URL to a git repository and a specific git commit. 
</ul>

This tutorial will demonstrate workflows that are part of the <b><a href="http://pantheonscience.org/e4s">Cinema E4S</a></b> project.
Each of these workflows uses open source science codes to create Cinema databases as output,
either through in-situ or post-processing methods.

<h3>Pantheon States</h3>

Pantheon defines several states for a workflow:

<ul>
    <li><b>Release</b>. This is a supported workflow, expected to work.</li>
    <li><b>Development</b>. This is a supported workflow, in development, but on its 
        way to <b>Release</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Experimental</b>. This workflow is provided as a record or example, 
        and may not work in all cases.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pantheon Metadata</h3>

A version of pantheon defines a set of metadata, typically included
in a workflow in a <code>pantheon.yaml</code> file. This is the current
metadata required by a project:
<pre>
<code>
pantheon:
    pantheon_version: 1.2 
    pantheon_state: string

project:
    project_name: string
    project_website: string

workflow:
    workflow_name: string
    workflow_desc: string 
    workflow_cinema-db: string
    workflow_workflow_app: string
    workflow_workflow_in-situ: string
    workflow_workflow_post-processing: string
           
contact: 
    contact_name: string  
    contact_email: string
</code>
</pre>
